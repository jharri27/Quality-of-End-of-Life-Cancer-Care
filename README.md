Project Description:

My colleagues and I explored and evaluated the cancer events dataset from the Dartmouth Atlas Project to identify any potential relationships between variables.  This dataset specifically recorded information on the quality of end-of-life care, and variables included differences in outcomes depending on geography, hospital admissions during the last month of life, and intensive care and chemotherapy during the last two weeks of life.

Instructions:
Execute the file 'IST687Group1Project.Rmd in R Studio.

Also, please view the presentation 'DAP Presentation 09.23.18.pptx' for my report.
